Given a set `S` and an element `b` in an order `β`, where all intervals bounded above are finite,
we define the partial density of `S` (relative to a set `A`) to be the proportion of elements in
`{x ∈ A | x < b}` that lie in `S ∩ A`.

This definition was inspired from https://github.com/b-mehta/unit-fractions

A set `S` in an order `β` where all intervals bounded above are finite is said to have
density `α : ℝ` (relative to a set `A`) if the proportion of `x ∈ S` such that `x < n`
in `A` tends to `α` as `n → ∞`.

When `β = ℕ` this by default defines the natural density of a set
(i.e., relative to all of `ℕ`).
