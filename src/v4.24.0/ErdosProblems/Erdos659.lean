This is a Lean formalization of a solution to Erdős Problem 659.
https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/659

This proof was found by Benjamin Grayzel using Gemini.

A similar result was given by Sheffer and Moree & Osburn:

https://adamsheffer.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/point-sets-with-few-distinct-distances/

https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604163


Grayzel's proof was auto-formalized by Aristotle (from Harmonic).  The
proof used "Perucca's classification theorem" (also given by Desmond
Weisenberg at the forum link above), which Aristotle proved by itself.

The final theorem statement was available from the Formal Conjectures
project (from Google DeepMind).

FYI: The proof assumes Bernay's theorem as an axiom!


The proof is verified by Lean.  The following version numbers were
used:

Lean Toolchain version: leanprover/lean4:v4.24.0
Mathlib version: f897ebcf72cd16f89ab4577d0c826cd14afaafc7 (v4.24.0)

We formalized the solution to the Erdős problem concerning distances and points.
We defined the lattice `L` and the point sets `P_m`.
We proved that `P_m` satisfies the local constraint (every 4 points determine at least 3 distances) by reducing it to the absence of squares, equilateral triangles, and golden ratio distances in `L`, which we verified.
We proved that the number of distinct distances in `P_m` is bounded by `B_Q(3m^2)`, where `Q` is the quadratic form `x^2 + 2y^2`.
Using Bernays' theorem (assumed as a hypothesis), we established the asymptotic bound `O(n / sqrt(log n))` for the number of distinct distances in a subset of size `n`.

I have proved Perucca's classification theorem (`PeruccaClassificationStatement_proof`) using some helper lemmas I established.

**Bernays' theorem (assumed as an axiom).**

Let `f(X,Y)=aX^2+bXY+cY^2` be a primitive positive definite binary quadratic form
with non-square discriminant `Δ`. Then there exists a constant `C_Δ > 0` such that
`B_f(x) ~ C_Δ * x / sqrt(log x)` as `x → ∞`.

We phrase this so that `C_Δ` depends only on `Δ` (and works for every `f` of that discriminant).
