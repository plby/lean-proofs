The Lean community / mathlib site features a page called [Missing
theorems from Freek Wiedijk's list of 100
theorems](https://leanprover-community.github.io/100-missing.html), as
well as a list of formalized results simply called [100
theorems](https://leanprover-community.github.io/100.html).

Both are based off of [Freek Wiedijk](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/)'s
list of [100 theorems](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/), which has
served as a benchmark for theorem provers.

As of the time of writing (2026/01/15), the page says:

> These theorems are not yet formalized in Lean. Currently there are
  17 of them. Among these, 0 have their statement formalized.

This is not correct.  Below, I organize some information about the
true state of affairs.

* 12: The Independence of the Parallel Postulate

* 13: Polyhedron Formula

* 21: Green’s Theorem

* 28: Pascal’s Hexagon Theorem

* 29: Feuerbach’s Theorem

* 32: The Four Color Problem

* 33: Fermat’s Last Theorem

* 41: Puiseux’s Theorem

* 43: The Isoperimetric Theorem

* 47: The Central Limit Theorem

* 50: The Number of Platonic Solids
